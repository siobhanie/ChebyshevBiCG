# ChebyshevBiCG

Simulations from the paper "Preconditioned Chebyshev BiCG for parameterized linear systems", Siobh√°n Correnty, Elias Jarlebring and Daniel B. Szyld 

The corresponding figures can be generated using the code provided here. 

Note:
1. The FEM matrices of arbitrary dimension can be generated with the script small_helm_bicg.py
2. Chebfun is required: https://www.chebfun.org/
